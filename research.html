My research interests focus on the application of mathematical
techniques to describe, model, and analyze physical and biological
systems, with particular emphasis on novel image reconstruction
methodologies and inverse problems in imaging.

    methods to remove 2&pi; discontinuities from 2-D phase profiles
    modulo 2&pi;. In 1-D this problem is straightforward, given
    sufficient sampling of the signal; in 2-D it's deceptively hard.
    In both FTP and 3-D DH, the surface profile is computed from the
    phase of a complex image and must be unwrapped to form a smooth
    depth map. Note the discontinuity at center in the image
    on the left, which has been removed in the image on the right. </TD>

    and filtering methods computationally eliminate the glint without

    Care must be taken not to extract too large an area to avoid

    Extracting too little reduces the scale of surface feature which
    can be reconstructed. </TD>

    several identical DH imaging systems improves image resolution
    without the cost (in both SWAP and $) of achieving that resolution
    in a single system. The image on the left is from one aperture;
    few groups of bars are resolvable. The image on the right is from
    four co-phased apertures; many groups of bars are now resolvable.
    See below for some details on coherently combining apertures. </TD>

  <TD VALIGN="TOP"> <B>Aperture cophasing for multiaperture digital
    holography:</B> to coherently combine apertures, they need to be
    aligned to within a fraction (1/12) of a wavelength
    (near-infra-red is around 1 micron). While extremely challenging
    using physical optics, phase corrections can easily be applied
    computationally. The right-hand image shows six hexagonal
    apertures co-phased to the center reference aperture. Only three
    variables are needed: piston, tip, and tilt. The left-hand plot
    shows iterations of Newton-Raphson optimization on isosurfaces of
    the sharpness metric for one pair of apertures. When the sharpness
    of an image formed by these apertures attains a maximum, the
    apertures are co-phased.  </TD>

    correct the resulting blur. The identified phase screen (right)

  Results of the above development are illustrated at left. The
  left image is distorted by (real) atmosphere; the right image has
  been restored using sharpness maximization in the Zernike
  basis. Almost no detail is visible in the uncorrected image; separation
  of the bars is discernable after restoration. Note also the presence
  of speckle noise (blobs) as this is a single (un-averaged) image. </TD>

  <TD VALIGN="TOP"> <B>Correction of anisotropy in digital holography
  through turbulent atmosphere:</B> restoration over isoplanatic patches
  and stitching. The assumption of a space-invariat
  kernel (point-spread-function, PSF) fails when the severity of
  the turbulence is large. Sharpness maximization over the whole
  image performs poorly since it does not account for the variations
  in the kernel. Once can independently apply sharpness maximization
  over sub-regions of the image to obtain much better results. That
  is, one breaks the large space-variant problem into multiple smaller
  space-invariant problems and then stiches the results back
  together. The left image shows restoration with a whole-image PSF; the
  right image has been restored with a single PSF optimized for the
  much smaller dashed box. </TD>
