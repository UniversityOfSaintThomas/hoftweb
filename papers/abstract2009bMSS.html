<B>Abstract:</B> 
Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies is developing laser-based
  technologies for stand-off 2D+3D face imaging for biometric
  identification. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the
  Department of Defense (DoD) desire the ability to capture biometric
  data from minimally cooperative subjects with a minimally invasive
  system at stand-off distances. The initial applications are fixed
  installations for relatively large volume access points such as
  security check points and transportation gateways for which minimal
  cooperation, stand-off operation, and real-time operation are
  desired so that the biometric identification process will have
  little impact on traffic flow. This system is also extendable to
  wide area surveillance applications when coupled with a wide field
  of view acquisition camera, tracking system, and rangefinder. The
  goals for the low-cost, stand- off 3D face imager include Class 1M
  eye-safe operation, 2D+3D face capture at >10-m stand-off distance,
  <1-mm lateral resolution, <1-mm range precision, and real-time
  capture and processing for walking speed, minimally cooperative
  subjects using technologies and techniques that will be low cost in
  production. Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies is developing both
  coherent and direct detection active imagers for biometrics
  applications. The coherent detection method is digital holography
  (presented in a companion paper) and the direct detection method is
  Fourier transform profilometry (FTP). In this paper, we report on
  the development of a tripod-mounted, breadboard direct detection
  2D+3D face imager based on FTP. We discuss the theory of FTP with
  references to the literature. We then describe our implementation of
  the FTP breadboard, and present experimental results using this
  breadboard. We conclude with a discussion of the design for a
  fieldable engineering demonstration unit (EDU).
