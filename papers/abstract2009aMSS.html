<B>Abstract:</B> 
Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies (LMCT) has demonstrated 3D face imaging at ~ 1-2 mm lateral resolution and range precision at stand-off distances up to 100 m using digital holography. LMCT has also demonstrated the digital holography technique in a multi-pixel vibrometry mode in the laboratory. In this paper, we report on 3D face imaging using multiple-source (MS) and multiple-wavelength (MW) digital holography breadboards. We will briefly discuss the theory of 3D imaging using MS and MW digital holography with references to the literature. We will also briefly discuss the theory of vibrometry using a digital holographic setup. We then describe our implementation of these techniques in breadboard setups operating at 1550 nm wavelength (for MS digital holography) and at wavelengths near 1617 nm (for MW digital holography). We also present experimental results for 3D imaging and for vibrometry with these digital holographic setups.
