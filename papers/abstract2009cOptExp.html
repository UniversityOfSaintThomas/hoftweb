<B>Abstract:</B> 
The performance of long distance imaging systems is typically degraded
  by phase errors imparted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper we
  apply coherent imaging methods to determine, and remove, these phase
  errors by digitally processing coherent recordings of the image
  data. In this manner we are able to remove the effects of
  atmospheric turbulence without needing a conventional adaptive
  optical system. Digital holographic detection is used to record the
  coherent, complex-valued, optical field for a series of atmospheric
  and object realizations. Correction of atmospheric phase errors is
  then based on maximizing an image sharpness metric to determine the
  aberrations present and correct the underlying image. Experimental
  results that demonstrate image recovery in the presence of
  turbulence are presented. Results obtained with severe turbulence
  that gives rise to anisoplanatism are also presented.
