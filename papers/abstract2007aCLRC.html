<B>Abstract:</B> 
With a multi-aperture imaging system, one creates a large imaging
  aperture by combining the light from a series of distributed
  telescopes. In doing this, one can construct a fine-resolution
  imaging system with reduced volume. We present work on
  multi-aperture, active imaging systems that use coherent detection
  and digital image formation. In such a system, the image formation
  process incorporates digital correction of optical and atmospheric
  phase errors. Here we discuss the principles underlying this method
  and present results from laboratory experiments and field
  experiments performed over a 0.5 km outdoor test range. In addition
  we discuss 3D imaging capability of the method.
