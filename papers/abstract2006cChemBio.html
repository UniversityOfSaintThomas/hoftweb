<B>Abstract:</B> 
Detection and discrimination of aerosolized biological weapons at
  standoff distances has proven to be a challenging task. Traditional
  approaches have proven to be successful for many types of
  applications, but have shown limitations under specific
  conditions. For instance, Ultra Violet Laser Induced Fluorescence
  (UV-LIF) has been the detection standard for many years, yet this
  technique is known to struggle to discriminate among biological
  aerosols as well as certain interferents. Lockheed Martin Coherent
  Technologies has developed a new detection scheme relying on
  multi-spectral polarization signatures to detect and discriminate
  biological agents from other non-biological aerosols as well as
  identification among different types of biological agents. This
  technique has proven to be successful against a variety of
  interferents including diesel exhaust. The polarization-sensitive
  method takes advantage of the morphology of the target aerosols as
  well as their absorptive properties which modifies the scattering of
  the multi-spectral light. This technique has unique potential for
  long-range standoff detection of biological agents operating in all
  light conditions (including daylight) in real-world battlefield
  environments. Fielded systems relying on this type of detection
  scheme have been proven successful in numerous field campaigns over
  a wide range of atmospheric conditions.
