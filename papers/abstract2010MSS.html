<B>Abstract:</B> 
Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies is developing laser-based
  technologies for stand-off 2D+3D face imaging for biometric
  identification. Among other potential industrial, commercial, and
  governmental users, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and
  the Department of Defense (DoD) desire the ability to capture
  biometric data from minimally cooperative subjects with a minimally
  invasive system at stand-off distances. The initial applications are
  fixed installations for relatively large volume access points such
  as security check points and transportation gateways for which
  minimal cooperation, stand-off operation, and real-time operation
  are desired so that the biometric identification process will have
  little impact on traffic flow. Last year we presented a paper on the
  development and testing of a 2D+3D face imager breadboard based on
  the Fourier Transform Profilometry (FTP) technique. In that paper,
  we also presented the design for a field testable Engineering
  Development Unit (EDU) FTP-based 2D+3D imager. In this paper, we
  report the development and testing of this EDU, including the
  extension of the mode of operation to include person and head
  tracking, and the use of the reference-less FTP technique for area
  surveillance applications with subjects at arbitrary ranges within
  the operating range of the system. The test results show that the
  EDU meets the goals for the 2D+3D face imager of Class 1M eye-safe
  operation, 2D+3D face capture at >20-m stand-off distance, ~1-mm
  lateral resolution, ~1-mm range precision, and real-time capture at
  1-Hz update rate for brisk walking speed (~1.5 m/s), minimally
  cooperative subjects using technologies and techniques that will be
  low cost in production.
